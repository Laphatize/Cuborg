# Cuborg
The Cuborg Discord Bot relies on the Cuborg Verification API. 
I don't plan on documenting the API (or releasing it). However, feel free
to document what you can using the code found in this bot. 

## How do I run Cuborg?
I suggest that you don't run Cuborg on your own computer/server. This can cause unexpected problems and
our support staff will not help you. If you want to add Cuborg to your server + support, then I suggest going
to https://cuborg.xyz/invite.

## Where can I get support?
First, ensure you've run the !setup command. If you're still having trouble setting it up, please feel free to ask our staff on the 
support server. <br> (https://discord.gg/Frpp3SQ)
